Algorithm RRLE-1
Find predic four bits that every on of this 0000-1111 matches change to two next one, block 1024 bits Do this size of //1000 times or less. 128 bits -1 bit or +1 if bigger few bytes or less. We try to predict variations of 4 bits. If we predict this variations and files we times of compress file +1 that we will save it we start from 0 and go to 15 and repeat this again and again about times on the top. When we predict and compress. If compress we write 0 else if file on the end compress 0 else 1 on the end we add 1 and left bits. Can exist 00-11 1 find before the number that front. If this 4 bits already exist or -1 we count as one 128 blocks big -1 or +1 bit. Compress every time. We save like this 0000 0101 1010 1111 two bits must be the same then next two bits. Find if equal zero
